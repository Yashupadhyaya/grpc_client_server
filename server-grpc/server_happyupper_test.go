Existing Test Information:
These test cases are already implemented and not included for test generation scenario:
File: grpc_client_server/server-grpc/server_test.go
Test Cases:
    [TestHappyUpper]

Scenario 1: Test with a single lowercase word

Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the happyUpper function when a single lowercase word is passed as argument. The target scenario is to verify if the function is able to convert the word to uppercase and append a smiley at the end.
Execution:
    Arrange: No setup required for this test.
    Act: Invoke the target function with a single lowercase word.
    Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify if the output is the uppercase version of the word with a smiley at the end.
Validation:
    The choice of assertion is to match the exact expected string, as the function should always return the uppercase version of the input string appended with a smiley. This test is important as it verifies the basic functionality of the function.

Scenario 2: Test with a numeric string

Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the happyUpper function when a numeric string is passed as argument. The target scenario is to verify if the function is able to append a smiley at the end of the numeric string.
Execution:
    Arrange: No setup required for this test.
    Act: Invoke the target function with a numeric string.
    Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify if the output is the numeric string with a smiley at the end.
Validation:
    The choice of assertion is to match the exact expected string, as the function should always return the input string appended with a smiley. This test is important as it verifies the function's handling of numeric strings.

Scenario 3: Test with an empty string

Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the happyUpper function when an empty string is passed as argument. The target scenario is to verify if the function is able to return just a smiley when no input is provided.
Execution:
    Arrange: No setup required for this test.
    Act: Invoke the target function with an empty string.
    Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify if the output is just a smiley.
Validation:
    The choice of assertion is to match the exact expected string, as the function should always return a smiley when no input is provided. This test is important as it verifies the function's handling of empty strings.

Scenario 4: Test with a string containing special characters

Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the happyUpper function when a string containing special characters is passed as argument. The target scenario is to verify if the function is able to handle special characters and append a smiley at the end.
Execution:
    Arrange: No setup required for this test.
    Act: Invoke the target function with a string containing special characters.
    Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify if the output is the input string with a smiley at the end.
Validation:
    The choice of assertion is to match the exact expected string, as the function should always return the input string appended with a smiley. This test is important as it verifies the function's handling of special characters.
