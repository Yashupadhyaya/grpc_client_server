File: grpc_client_server/server-grpc/server_test.go
Test Cases:
    [TestHappyUpper]

Scenario 1: Test with a single lowercase letter

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the happyUpper function when a single lowercase letter is passed as argument. The target scenario is to ensure the function correctly converts the lowercase letter to uppercase and appends the happy emoji to it.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific data setup is required.
  Act: Invoke the happyUpper function with a single lowercase letter.
  Assert: Use the Go testing facilities to check if the returned string is the uppercase version of the input letter appended with the happy emoji.
Validation:
  The choice of assertion is to ensure that the function correctly handles and processes a single lowercase letter. The test is important in ensuring that even the smallest valid input is correctly processed by the function.

Scenario 2: Test with a string of lowercase letters

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the happyUpper function when a string of lowercase letters is passed as argument. The target scenario is to ensure the function correctly converts all the letters in the string to uppercase and appends the happy emoji to it.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific data setup is required.
  Act: Invoke the happyUpper function with a string of lowercase letters.
  Assert: Use the Go testing facilities to check if the returned string is the uppercase version of the input string appended with the happy emoji.
Validation:
  The assertion is chosen to ensure that the function correctly handles and processes a string of lowercase letters. This test is important in verifying that the function can handle standard input and return the expected output.

Scenario 3: Test with a string of mixed case letters

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the happyUpper function when a string of mixed case letters is passed as argument. The target scenario is to ensure the function correctly converts all the letters in the string to uppercase and appends the happy emoji to it.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific data setup is required.
  Act: Invoke the happyUpper function with a string of mixed case letters.
  Assert: Use the Go testing facilities to check if the returned string is the uppercase version of the input string appended with the happy emoji.
Validation:
  The chosen assertion is to ensure that the function correctly handles and processes a string of mixed case letters. This test is important in verifying that the function can handle different letter cases in the input string and return the expected output.

Scenario 4: Test with a string containing non-alphabetic characters

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the happyUpper function when a string containing non-alphabetic characters is passed as argument. The target scenario is to ensure the function correctly appends the happy emoji to the input string without altering the non-alphabetic characters.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific data setup is required.
  Act: Invoke the happyUpper function with a string containing non-alphabetic characters.
  Assert: Use the Go testing facilities to check if the returned string is the input string appended with the happy emoji.
Validation:
  The assertion is chosen to ensure that the function correctly handles and processes a string containing non-alphabetic characters. This test is important in verifying that the function can handle different types of characters in the input string and return the expected output.

Scenario 5: Test with an empty string

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the happyUpper function when an empty string is passed as argument. The target scenario is to ensure the function correctly returns a string containing only the happy emoji.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific data setup is required.
  Act: Invoke the happyUpper function with an empty string.
  Assert: Use the Go testing facilities to check if the returned string is a string containing only the happy emoji.
Validation:
  The assertion is chosen to ensure that the function correctly handles and processes an empty string. This test is important in verifying that the function can handle edge cases and return the expected output.
