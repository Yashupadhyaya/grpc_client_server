Existing Test Information:
These test cases are already implemented and not included for test generation scenario:
File: grpc_client_server/server-grpc/server_test.go
Test Cases:
    [TestHappyUpper]

Scenario 1: Test with a single lowercase word

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the happyUpper function when a single lowercase word is passed as argument. The target scenario is the normal operation of the function.

Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement needed as the function does not depend on any external data.
  Act: Invoke the happyUpper function with a single lowercase word as argument.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the returned string is the uppercase version of the input string, followed by "ðŸ˜Š".

Validation:
  The assertion is checking if the function correctly converts the input string to uppercase and appends the happy emoji. This test is important as it checks the core functionality of the happyUpper function.

Scenario 2: Test with multiple words

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the happyUpper function when multiple words are passed as argument. The target scenario is the normal operation of the function.

Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement needed as the function does not depend on any external data.
  Act: Invoke the happyUpper function with multiple words as argument.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the returned string is the uppercase version of the input string, followed by "ðŸ˜Š".

Validation:
  The assertion is checking if the function correctly converts the entire input string to uppercase and appends the happy emoji. This test is important as it checks how the function handles multiple words.

Scenario 3: Test with empty string

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the happyUpper function when an empty string is passed as argument. The target scenario is the edge case where the input string is empty.

Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement needed as the function does not depend on any external data.
  Act: Invoke the happyUpper function with an empty string as argument.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the returned string is just the happy emoji.

Validation:
  The assertion is checking if the function correctly handles an empty string and returns only the happy emoji. This test is important as it checks how the function handles edge cases.

Scenario 4: Test with numbers and special characters

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the happyUpper function when a string with numbers and special characters is passed as argument. The target scenario is the edge case where the input string contains numbers and special characters.

Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement needed as the function does not depend on any external data.
  Act: Invoke the happyUpper function with a string containing numbers and special characters as argument.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the returned string is the same as the input string, followed by "ðŸ˜Š".

Validation:
  The assertion is checking if the function correctly handles a string with numbers and special characters and returns it as is, followed by the happy emoji. This test is important as it checks how the function handles edge cases with different types of characters.
