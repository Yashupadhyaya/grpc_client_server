Existing Test Information:
These test cases are already implemented and not included for test generation scenario:
File: grpc_client_server/server-grpc/server_test.go
Test Cases:
    [TestHappyUpper]

Scenario 1: Testing happyUpper with a normal string

Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check if the function happyUpper correctly converts a normal string into uppercase and appends a "ðŸ˜Š" at the end.
Execution:
    Arrange: No setup is required as the function does not depend on any external entities.
    Act: Invoke the function happyUpper with a normal string such as "test".
    Assert: Use the Go testing facilities to verify that the result is "TESTðŸ˜Š".
Validation:
    The assertion checks if the function correctly converts a string into uppercase and appends a "ðŸ˜Š" at the end. This is important as it tests the main functionality of the function.

Scenario 2: Testing happyUpper with an empty string

Details:
    Description: This test is meant to verify if the function happyUpper correctly handles an empty string by returning only the "ðŸ˜Š".
Execution:
    Arrange: No setup is required as the function does not depend on any external entities.
    Act: Invoke the function happyUpper with an empty string.
    Assert: Use the Go testing facilities to verify that the result is "ðŸ˜Š".
Validation:
    The assertion checks if the function correctly handles an empty string by returning only the "ðŸ˜Š". This test is important as it covers an edge case where the input string is empty. 

Scenario 3: Testing happyUpper with a string that contains numbers and symbols

Details:
    Description: This test is meant to verify if the function happyUpper correctly handles a string that contains numbers and symbols.
Execution:
    Arrange: No setup is required as the function does not depend on any external entities.
    Act: Invoke the function happyUpper with a string such as "123$%^".
    Assert: Use the Go testing facilities to verify that the result is "123$%^ðŸ˜Š".
Validation:
    The assertion checks if the function correctly handles a string that contains numbers and symbols by not altering them and appending a "ðŸ˜Š" at the end. This test is important as it covers an edge case where the input string contains characters other than alphabets. 

Scenario 4: Testing happyUpper with a string that contains uppercase letters

Details:
    Description: This test is meant to verify if the function happyUpper handles a string that already contains uppercase letters correctly.
Execution:
    Arrange: No setup is required as the function does not depend on any external entities.
    Act: Invoke the function happyUpper with a string such as "Test".
    Assert: Use the Go testing facilities to verify that the result is "TESTðŸ˜Š".
Validation:
    The assertion checks if the function correctly handles a string that contains uppercase letters by not altering them and appending a "ðŸ˜Š" at the end. This test is important as it covers a scenario where the input string contains both lowercase and uppercase letters.
