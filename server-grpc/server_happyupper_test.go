Existing Test Information:
These test cases are already implemented and not included for test generation scenario:
File: grpc_client_server/server-grpc/server_test.go
Test Cases:
    [TestHappyUpper]

Scenario 1: Testing with Alphanumeric Characters

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check if the function operates correctly on alphanumeric inputs. It is important as it ensures that the function can handle mixed input of letters and numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: The input string will be a mix of letters and numbers, such as "abc123".
  Act: The function happyUpper will be invoked with the arranged input.
  Assert: The expected output should be the uppercase version of the input string followed by the happy emoji, for example, "ABC123ðŸ˜Š".
Validation:
  The choice of assertion is based on the function's expected behavior of converting all characters to uppercase and appending a happy emoji. This test is important to ensure that the function can handle alphanumeric inputs correctly.

Scenario 2: Testing with Special Characters

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check if the function operates correctly on special character inputs. It is important as it ensures that the function can handle non-alphanumeric characters.
Execution:
  Arrange: The input string will be a mix of special characters, such as "#$%^".
  Act: The function happyUpper will be invoked with the arranged input.
  Assert: The expected output should be the uppercase version of the input string followed by the happy emoji, for example, "#$%^ðŸ˜Š".
Validation:
  The choice of assertion is based on the function's expected behavior of converting all characters to uppercase and appending a happy emoji. This test is important to ensure that the function can handle special character inputs correctly.

Scenario 3: Testing with Empty String

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check if the function operates correctly on an empty string. It is important as it ensures that the function can handle empty string inputs.
Execution:
  Arrange: The input string will be an empty string, "".
  Act: The function happyUpper will be invoked with the arranged input.
  Assert: The expected output should be just the happy emoji, "ðŸ˜Š".
Validation:
  The choice of assertion is based on the function's expected behavior of converting all characters to uppercase and appending a happy emoji. In this case, since there are no characters to convert, the output should be just the emoji. This test is important to ensure that the function handles empty string inputs correctly.

Scenario 4: Testing with Non-English Characters

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check if the function operates correctly on non-English characters. It is important as it ensures that the function can handle international inputs.
Execution:
  Arrange: The input string will be a string of non-English characters, such as "Ã¤Ã¶Ã¼ÃŸ".
  Act: The function happyUpper will be invoked with the arranged input.
  Assert: The expected output should be the uppercase version of the input string followed by the happy emoji, for example, "Ã„Ã–ÃœáºžðŸ˜Š".
Validation:
  The choice of assertion is based on the function's expected behavior of converting all characters to uppercase and appending a happy emoji. This test is important to ensure that the function can handle non-English inputs correctly.
