Existing Test Information:
These test cases are already implemented and not included for test generation scenario:
File: grpc_client_server/server-grpc/server_test.go
Test Cases:
    [TestHappyUpper]

Scenario 1: Test with a single lowercase word

Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the happyUpper function with a single lowercase word as input.
Execution:
    Arrange: No arrangement required as the function does not depend on any external data.
    Act: Invoke the happyUpper function with a single lowercase word as input.
    Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the output is the input word in uppercase followed by a smiley emoji.
Validation:
    The assertion is chosen to verify that the function correctly converts the input to uppercase and appends a smiley emoji. This test is important to ensure the basic functionality of the happyUpper function.

Scenario 2: Test with an empty string

Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the happyUpper function when an empty string is passed as input.
Execution:
    Arrange: No arrangement required as the function does not depend on any external data.
    Act: Invoke the happyUpper function with an empty string as input.
    Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the output is just a smiley emoji.
Validation:
    The assertion is chosen to verify that the function correctly handles empty input and returns only a smiley emoji. This test is important to ensure the happyUpper function handles edge cases correctly.

Scenario 3: Test with a string containing numbers and special characters

Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the happyUpper function when a string containing numbers and special characters is passed as input.
Execution:
    Arrange: No arrangement required as the function does not depend on any external data.
    Act: Invoke the happyUpper function with a string containing numbers and special characters as input.
    Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the output is the input string followed by a smiley emoji.
Validation:
    The assertion is chosen to verify that the function correctly handles input containing numbers and special characters and returns the input followed by a smiley emoji. This test is important to ensure the happyUpper function handles different types of input correctly.
