Existing Test Information:
These test cases are already implemented and not included for test generation scenario:
File: grpc_client_server/server-grpc/server_test.go
Test Cases:
    [TestHappyUpper]

Scenario 1: Test with Regular String

Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check the function's ability to convert a regular string into uppercase and append a happy emoji at the end.
Execution:
    Arrange: We need a regular string for this test.
    Act: Pass the string to the happyUpper function.
    Assert: Verify that the function returns the string in uppercase followed by a happy emoji.
Validation:
    The assertion checks that the function is correctly converting the string to uppercase and appending a happy emoji. This test is important to confirm that the function works correctly with regular string inputs.

Scenario 2: Test with Empty String

Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check the function's behavior when an empty string is passed.
Execution:
    Arrange: We need an empty string for this test.
    Act: Pass the empty string to the happyUpper function.
    Assert: Verify that the function returns just the happy emoji.
Validation:
    The assertion checks that the function handles the edge case of an empty string correctly by returning just a happy emoji. This test is important to confirm that the function can handle edge cases.

Scenario 3: Test with Numeric String

Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check the function's behavior when a numeric string is passed.
Execution:
    Arrange: We need a numeric string for this test.
    Act: Pass the numeric string to the happyUpper function.
    Assert: Verify that the function returns the numeric string as it is followed by a happy emoji.
Validation:
    The assertion checks that the function correctly handles numeric strings by not altering them and appending a happy emoji. This test is important to confirm that the function can handle different types of string inputs.

Scenario 4: Test with Special Characters String

Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check the function's behavior when a string with special characters is passed.
Execution:
    Arrange: We need a string with special characters for this test.
    Act: Pass the string with special characters to the happyUpper function.
    Assert: Verify that the function returns the string as it is followed by a happy emoji.
Validation:
    The assertion checks that the function correctly handles strings with special characters by not altering them and appending a happy emoji. This test is important to confirm that the function can handle all types of string inputs.

Scenario 5: Test with Mixed Case String

Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check the function's behavior when a string with mixed case characters is passed.
Execution:
    Arrange: We need a string with mixed case characters for this test.
    Act: Pass the string with mixed case characters to the happyUpper function.
    Assert: Verify that the function returns the string in uppercase followed by a happy emoji.
Validation:
    The assertion checks that the function is correctly converting the string to uppercase regardless of the original case and appending a happy emoji. This test is important to confirm that the function works correctly with mixed case strings.
