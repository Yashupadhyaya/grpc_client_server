File: grpc_client_server/server-grpc/server_test.go
Test Cases:
    [TestHappyUpper]

Scenario 1: Test with a single lowercase letter

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the happyUpper function when a single lowercase letter is passed as argument. The target scenario is to ensure the function correctly converts the lowercase letter to uppercase and appends the happy emoji.

Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement needed as the function takes a string as input.
  Act: Invoke the happyUpper function with a single lowercase letter.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the actual result matches the expected outcome.

Validation:
  The assertion choice is to check if the function correctly converts the lowercase letter to uppercase and appends the happy emoji. The expected result is important in ensuring that the function correctly handles single character inputs.

Scenario 2: Test with a string of lowercase letters

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the happyUpper function when a string of lowercase letters is passed as argument. The target scenario is to ensure the function correctly converts all the lowercase letters to uppercase and appends the happy emoji.

Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement needed as the function takes a string as input.
  Act: Invoke the happyUpper function with a string of lowercase letters.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the actual result matches the expected outcome.

Validation:
  The assertion choice is to check if the function correctly converts all the lowercase letters to uppercase and appends the happy emoji. The expected result is important in ensuring that the function correctly handles string inputs.

Scenario 3: Test with a string of numbers

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the happyUpper function when a string of numbers is passed as argument. The target scenario is to ensure the function correctly returns the numbers as they are and appends the happy emoji.

Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement needed as the function takes a string as input.
  Act: Invoke the happyUpper function with a string of numbers.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the actual result matches the expected outcome.

Validation:
  The assertion choice is to check if the function correctly returns the numbers as they are and appends the happy emoji. The expected result is important in ensuring that the function correctly handles numeric inputs.

Scenario 4: Test with an empty string

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the happyUpper function when an empty string is passed as argument. The target scenario is to ensure the function correctly returns just the happy emoji.

Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement needed as the function takes a string as input.
  Act: Invoke the happyUpper function with an empty string.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the actual result matches the expected outcome.

Validation:
  The assertion choice is to check if the function correctly returns just the happy emoji when an empty string is passed. The expected result is important in ensuring that the function correctly handles empty inputs.
