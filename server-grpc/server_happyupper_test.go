Existing Test Information:
These test cases are already implemented and not included for test generation scenario:
File: grpc_client_server/server-grpc/server_test.go
Test Cases:
    [TestHappyUpper]

Scenario 1: Testing with a single lowercase character

Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check if the function correctly transforms a single lowercase character to uppercase and appends the happy face emoji at the end.
Execution:
    Arrange: No prior arrangement is required as the function does not depend on any external state.
    Act: Invoke the happyUpper function with a single lowercase character.
    Assert: Verify that the returned string is the uppercase version of the input character followed by the happy face emoji.
Validation:
    This test is important as it verifies the basic functionality of the happyUpper function with the simplest possible input. The expected result is based on the documented behavior of the function.

Scenario 2: Testing with a string of lowercase characters

Details:
    Description: This test is meant to verify if the function correctly transforms a string of lowercase characters to uppercase and appends the happy face emoji at the end.
Execution:
    Arrange: No prior arrangement is required as the function does not depend on any external state.
    Act: Invoke the happyUpper function with a string of lowercase characters.
    Assert: Verify that the returned string is the uppercase version of the input string followed by the happy face emoji.
Validation:
    This test is important as it verifies the functionality of the function with a more complex input. The expected result is based on the documented behavior of the function.

Scenario 3: Testing with a string of mixed-case characters

Details:
    Description: This test is meant to verify if the function correctly transforms a string of mixed-case characters to uppercase and appends the happy face emoji at the end. This test also verifies that the function does not alter non-alphabetic characters.
Execution:
    Arrange: No prior arrangement is required as the function does not depend on any external state.
    Act: Invoke the happyUpper function with a string of mixed-case characters.
    Assert: Verify that the returned string is the uppercase version of the input string followed by the happy face emoji. The non-alphabetic characters should remain unchanged.
Validation:
    This test is important as it verifies the function's behavior with a variety of inputs. The expected result is based on the documented behavior of the function.

Scenario 4: Testing with an empty string

Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check if the function correctly handles an empty string as input and returns the happy face emoji.
Execution:
    Arrange: No prior arrangement is required as the function does not depend on any external state.
    Act: Invoke the happyUpper function with an empty string.
    Assert: Verify that the returned string is the happy face emoji.
Validation:
    This test is important as it verifies the function's behavior with edge case inputs. The expected result is based on the documented behavior of the function.
