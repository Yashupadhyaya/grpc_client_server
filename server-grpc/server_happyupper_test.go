Existing Test Information:
These test cases are already implemented and not included for test generation scenario:
File: grpc_client_server/server-grpc/server_test.go
Test Cases:
    [TestHappyUpper]

Scenario 1: Test with a regular string
Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the happyUpper function with a regular string input. The target scenario is when the function is used in normal operation with a string that contains both upper and lower case letters.
Execution:
    Arrange: No setup is required as the function takes a string as input.
    Act: Invoke the target function with a string that contains both upper and lower case letters.
    Assert: Use Go testing to verify that the actual results match the expected outcomes.
Validation:
    The assertion would check if the returned string is the input string converted to upper case and appended with "ðŸ˜Š". This test is important to ensure that the function behaves as expected in normal operation.

Scenario 2: Test with an empty string
Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the happyUpper function with an empty string input. The target scenario is when the function is used with no string input.
Execution:
    Arrange: No setup is required as the function takes a string as input.
    Act: Invoke the target function with an empty string.
    Assert: Use Go testing to verify that the actual results match the expected outcomes.
Validation:
    The assertion would check if the returned string is just "ðŸ˜Š" as there was no input string to convert to upper case. This test is important to ensure that the function behaves as expected when no string is provided.

Scenario 3: Test with a string containing special characters
Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the happyUpper function with a string that contains special characters. The target scenario is when the function is used with a string that contains characters other than letters and numbers.
Execution:
    Arrange: No setup is required as the function takes a string as input.
    Act: Invoke the target function with a string that contains special characters.
    Assert: Use Go testing to verify that the actual results match the expected outcomes.
Validation:
    The assertion would check if the returned string is the input string converted to upper case (where applicable) and appended with "ðŸ˜Š". This test is important to ensure that the function behaves as expected when the string contains special characters.

Scenario 4: Test with a string containing numbers
Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the happyUpper function with a string that contains numbers. The target scenario is when the function is used with a string that contains numbers along with letters.
Execution:
    Arrange: No setup is required as the function takes a string as input.
    Act: Invoke the target function with a string that contains numbers.
    Assert: Use Go testing to verify that the actual results match the expected outcomes.
Validation:
    The assertion would check if the returned string is the input string converted to upper case (where applicable) and appended with "ðŸ˜Š". This test is important to ensure that the function behaves as expected when the string contains numbers.
