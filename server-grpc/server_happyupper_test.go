Existing Test Information:
These test cases are already implemented and not included for test generation scenario:
File: grpc_client_server/server-grpc/server_test.go
Test Cases:
    [TestHappyUpper]

Scenario 1: Test with a single lowercase word

Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the happyUpper function when a single lowercase word is passed as argument. The target scenario is to verify if the function is able to convert the word to uppercase and append a smiley at the end.
Execution:
    Arrange: No setup required for this test.
    Act: Invoke the target function with a single lowercase word.
    Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify if the output is the uppercase version of the input word with a smiley appended at the end.
Validation:
    The assertion checks if the function is able to convert the input string to uppercase and append a smiley at the end. This test is important to ensure that the function behaves as expected with normal inputs.

Scenario 2: Test with a string containing numbers

Details:
    Description: This test is designed to check the behavior of the happyUpper function when a string containing numbers is passed as argument. The target scenario is to verify if the function returns the string as it is with a smiley appended at the end.
Execution:
    Arrange: No setup required for this test.
    Act: Invoke the target function with a string containing numbers.
    Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify if the output is the same as the input string with a smiley appended at the end.
Validation:
    The assertion checks if the function is able to handle strings containing numbers and append a smiley at the end. This test is important to ensure that the function behaves as expected with such inputs.

Scenario 3: Test with an empty string

Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the happyUpper function when an empty string is passed as argument. The target scenario is to verify if the function returns a smiley as the output.
Execution:
    Arrange: No setup required for this test.
    Act: Invoke the target function with an empty string.
    Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify if the output is a smiley.
Validation:
    The assertion checks if the function is able to handle an empty string and return a smiley as the output. This test is important to ensure that the function behaves as expected with such inputs.

Scenario 4: Test with a string containing special characters

Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the happyUpper function when a string containing special characters is passed as argument. The target scenario is to verify if the function returns the string as it is with a smiley appended at the end.
Execution:
    Arrange: No setup required for this test.
    Act: Invoke the target function with a string containing special characters.
    Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify if the output is the same as the input string with a smiley appended at the end.
Validation:
    The assertion checks if the function is able to handle strings containing special characters and append a smiley at the end. This test is important to ensure that the function behaves as expected with such inputs.
