Existing Test Information:
These test cases are already implemented and not included for test generation scenario:
File: grpc_client_server/server-grpc/server_test.go
Test Cases:
    [TestHappyUpper]

Scenario 1: Test with a Regular String

Details:
Description: This test is meant to check the happyUpper function's ability to convert a regular string into uppercase and append a happy emoji at the end.
Execution:
Arrange: The input string for this scenario is a regular word like "hello".
Act: The happyUpper function is called with the input string.
Assert: The returned string is checked to be "HELLOðŸ˜Š".
Validation:
The assertion is chosen to confirm that the happyUpper function correctly converts the string to uppercase and appends a happy emoji. This is important for the application to ensure that the function works as expected with regular strings.

Scenario 2: Test with an Empty String

Details:
Description: This test is meant to check the happyUpper function's behavior when called with an empty string.
Execution:
Arrange: The input string for this scenario is "" (an empty string).
Act: The happyUpper function is called with the input string.
Assert: The returned string is checked to be "ðŸ˜Š".
Validation:
The assertion is chosen to confirm that the happyUpper function correctly handles an empty string by returning just the happy emoji. This is important for the application to ensure that the function works as expected with edge cases.

Scenario 3: Test with a String Containing Numbers

Details:
Description: This test is meant to check the happyUpper function's behavior when called with a string containing numbers.
Execution:
Arrange: The input string for this scenario is "abc123".
Act: The happyUpper function is called with the input string.
Assert: The returned string is checked to be "ABC123ðŸ˜Š".
Validation:
The assertion is chosen to confirm that the happyUpper function correctly handles a string containing numbers by converting the alphabetic characters to uppercase, leaving the numbers as is, and appending a happy emoji. This is important for the application to ensure that the function works as expected with various types of input.

Scenario 4: Test with a String Containing Special Characters

Details:
Description: This test is meant to check the happyUpper function's behavior when called with a string containing special characters.
Execution:
Arrange: The input string for this scenario is "abc!@#".
Act: The happyUpper function is called with the input string.
Assert: The returned string is checked to be "ABC!@#ðŸ˜Š".
Validation:
The assertion is chosen to confirm that the happyUpper function correctly handles a string containing special characters by converting the alphabetic characters to uppercase, leaving the special characters as is, and appending a happy emoji. This is important for the application to ensure that the function works as expected with various types of input.
