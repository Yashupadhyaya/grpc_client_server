File: grpc_client_server/server-grpc/server_test.go
Test Cases:
    [TestHappyUpper]

Scenario 1: Test with a Regular String

Details:
Description: This test is meant to check the happyUpper function's ability to convert a regular string into uppercase and append a happy emoji at the end.
Execution:
Arrange: The test input string should be a regular string, such as "hello"
Act: Invoke the happyUpper function with the input string.
Assert: The output should be the input string in uppercase appended with a happy emoji, i.e., "HELLOðŸ˜Š".
Validation:
The assertion checks if the function correctly converts the input string to uppercase and appends a happy emoji at the end. This is crucial for the application's feature that displays user messages in a friendly, engaging manner.

Scenario 2: Test with an Empty String

Details:
Description: This test is meant to check how the happyUpper function handles an empty string.
Execution:
Arrange: The test input string should be an empty string.
Act: Invoke the happyUpper function with the empty string.
Assert: The output should only be a happy emoji, i.e., "ðŸ˜Š".
Validation:
The assertion checks if the function correctly handles empty strings by returning only a happy emoji. This is important for ensuring the function's robustness and reliability in handling different types of input.

Scenario 3: Test with a String Containing Special Characters

Details:
Description: This test is meant to check how the happyUpper function handles strings containing special characters.
Execution:
Arrange: The test input string should be a string containing special characters, such as "@#$$%"
Act: Invoke the happyUpper function with the input string.
Assert: The output should be the input string in uppercase appended with a happy emoji, i.e., "@#$$%ðŸ˜Š".
Validation:
The assertion checks if the function correctly converts the input string to uppercase and appends a happy emoji at the end, even when the string contains special characters. This is crucial for ensuring the function's versatility and robustness.

Scenario 4: Test with a Numeric String

Details:
Description: This test is meant to check how the happyUpper function handles strings containing only numbers.
Execution:
Arrange: The test input string should be a string containing only numbers, such as "12345"
Act: Invoke the happyUpper function with the input string.
Assert: The output should be the input string appended with a happy emoji, i.e., "12345ðŸ˜Š".
Validation:
The assertion checks if the function correctly appends a happy emoji to the end of a numeric string. This is crucial for ensuring the function can handle different types of string input.

Scenario 5: Test with a String Containing Both Alphabets and Numbers

Details:
Description: This test is meant to check how the happyUpper function handles strings containing both alphabets and numbers.
Execution:
Arrange: The test input string should be a string containing both alphabets and numbers, such as "abc123"
Act: Invoke the happyUpper function with the input string.
Assert: The output should be the input string in uppercase appended with a happy emoji, i.e., "ABC123ðŸ˜Š".
Validation:
The assertion checks if the function correctly converts the input string to uppercase and appends a happy emoji at the end, even when the string contains both alphabets and numbers. This is crucial for ensuring the function's versatility and robustness.
