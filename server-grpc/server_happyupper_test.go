Existing Test Information:
These test cases are already implemented and not included for test generation scenario:
File: grpc_client_server/server-grpc/server_test.go
Test Cases:
    [TestHappyUpper]

Scenario 1: Test with a Regular String

Details:
Description: This test is meant to check the happyUpper function's ability to convert a regular string into uppercase and append a happy emoji at the end.
Execution:
Arrange: The input string for this scenario is a regular word like "hello".
Act: The happyUpper function is called with the input string.
Assert: The returned string is checked to be "HELLOðŸ˜Š".
Validation:
The assertion is chosen to confirm that the happyUpper function correctly converts the string to uppercase and appends a happy emoji. This is important for the application to ensure that the function works as expected with regular strings.

Scenario 2: Test with an Empty String

Details:
Description: This test is meant to check the happyUpper function's ability to handle an empty string.
Execution:
Arrange: The input string for this scenario is an empty string "".
Act: The happyUpper function is called with the input string.
Assert: The returned string is checked to be "ðŸ˜Š".
Validation:
The assertion is chosen to confirm that the happyUpper function correctly handles an empty string by returning only a happy emoji. This is important for the application to ensure that the function doesn't crash or behave unexpectedly when given an empty string.

Scenario 3: Test with a String Containing Special Characters

Details:
Description: This test is meant to check the happyUpper function's ability to handle a string containing special characters.
Execution:
Arrange: The input string for this scenario is a string containing special characters like "hello@world!".
Act: The happyUpper function is called with the input string.
Assert: The returned string is checked to be "HELLO@WORLD!ðŸ˜Š".
Validation:
The assertion is chosen to confirm that the happyUpper function correctly handles a string with special characters by converting it to uppercase and appending a happy emoji. This is important for the application to ensure that the function doesn't crash or behave unexpectedly when given a string with special characters.

Scenario 4: Test with a String Containing Numbers

Details:
Description: This test is meant to check the happyUpper function's ability to handle a string containing numbers.
Execution:
Arrange: The input string for this scenario is a string containing numbers like "1234abc".
Act: The happyUpper function is called with the input string.
Assert: The returned string is checked to be "1234ABCðŸ˜Š".
Validation:
The assertion is chosen to confirm that the happyUpper function correctly handles a string with numbers by converting it to uppercase and appending a happy emoji. This is important for the application to ensure that the function doesn't crash or behave unexpectedly when given a string with numbers.
