Existing Test Information:
These test cases are already implemented and not included for test generation scenario:
File: grpc_client_server/server-grpc/server_test.go
Test Cases:
    [TestHappyUpper]

Scenario 1: Test with a Regular String

Details:
Description: This test is meant to check the happyUpper function's ability to convert a regular string into uppercase and append a happy emoji at the end.
Execution:
Arrange: The input string for this test would be a regular string such as "hello".
Act: Invoke the happyUpper function with the input string.
Assert: Use the Go testing facilities to verify that the output string is "HELLOðŸ˜Š".
Validation:
The assertion choice is straightforward since the function is expected to convert the input string into uppercase and append a happy emoji at the end. This test is important to verify the basic functionality of the happyUpper function.

Scenario 2: Test with an Empty String

Details:
Description: This test is meant to check the happyUpper function's behavior when an empty string is passed as input.
Execution:
Arrange: The input string for this test would be an empty string.
Act: Invoke the happyUpper function with the input string.
Assert: Use the Go testing facilities to verify that the output string is "ðŸ˜Š".
Validation:
The assertion choice is based on the fact that since the input string is empty, the output should only consist of the happy emoji. This test is crucial to ensure that the function handles edge cases properly.

Scenario 3: Test with Numeric String

Details:
Description: This test is meant to check the happyUpper function's behavior when a numeric string is passed as input.
Execution:
Arrange: The input string for this test would be a numeric string such as "1234".
Act: Invoke the happyUpper function with the input string.
Assert: Use the Go testing facilities to verify that the output string is "1234ðŸ˜Š".
Validation:
The assertion choice is based on the fact that since the input string is numeric, the output should only consist of the same numeric string with a happy emoji appended at the end. This test is crucial to ensure that the function handles different types of input correctly.

Scenario 4: Test with Special Characters String

Details:
Description: This test is meant to check the happyUpper function's behavior when a string with special characters is passed as input.
Execution:
Arrange: The input string for this test would be a special characters string such as "@#$%".
Act: Invoke the happyUpper function with the input string.
Assert: Use the Go testing facilities to verify that the output string is "@#$%ðŸ˜Š".
Validation:
The assertion choice is based on the fact that since the input string is made of special characters, the output should only consist of the same special characters string with a happy emoji appended at the end. This test is crucial to ensure that the function handles different types of input correctly.
