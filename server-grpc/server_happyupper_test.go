File: grpc_client_server/server-grpc/server_test.go
Test Cases:
    [TestHappyUpper]

Scenario 1: Test with a single lowercase letter

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the happyUpper function when a single lowercase letter is passed as argument. The target scenario is to verify if the function is able to convert the letter to uppercase and append the smiley at the end.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required
  Act: Invoke the happyUpper function with a single lowercase letter as parameter.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify if the returned string is the uppercase version of the input letter followed by a smiley.
Validation:
  The choice of assertion is to match the exact expected string with the actual result. The expected result is derived based on the functionality of the function. This test is important to ensure that the function is able to handle and correctly process single letter strings.

Scenario 2: Test with a string of lowercase letters

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the happyUpper function when a string of lowercase letters is passed as argument. The target scenario is to verify if the function is able to convert the entire string to uppercase and append the smiley at the end.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required
  Act: Invoke the happyUpper function with a string of lowercase letters as parameter.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify if the returned string is the uppercase version of the input string followed by a smiley.
Validation:
  The choice of assertion is to match the exact expected string with the actual result. The expected result is derived based on the functionality of the function. This test is important to ensure that the function is able to handle and correctly process longer strings.

Scenario 3: Test with an empty string

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the happyUpper function when an empty string is passed as argument. The target scenario is to verify if the function is able to handle empty strings and correctly return only the smiley.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required
  Act: Invoke the happyUpper function with an empty string as parameter.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify if the returned string is only the smiley.
Validation:
  The choice of assertion is to match the exact expected string with the actual result. The expected result is derived based on the functionality of the function. This test is important to ensure that the function is able to handle and correctly process empty strings.

Scenario 4: Test with a string containing numbers

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the happyUpper function when a string containing numbers is passed as argument. The target scenario is to verify if the function is able to handle such strings and correctly return the input string followed by a smiley.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required
  Act: Invoke the happyUpper function with a string containing numbers as parameter.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify if the returned string is the input string followed by a smiley.
Validation:
  The choice of assertion is to match the exact expected string with the actual result. The expected result is derived based on the functionality of the function. This test is important to ensure that the function is able to handle and correctly process strings containing numbers.
