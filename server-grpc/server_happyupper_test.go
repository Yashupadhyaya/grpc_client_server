Existing Test Information:
These test cases are already implemented and not included for test generation scenario:
File: grpc_client_server/server-grpc/server_test.go
Test Cases:
    [TestHappyUpper]

Scenario 1: Test with a lowercase string

Details:
Description: This test is meant to check if the function correctly converts a lowercase string to uppercase and adds the happy emoji at the end.
Execution:
Arrange: Provide a lowercase string as input.
Act: Invoke the happyUpper function with the arranged input.
Assert: Assert that the returned string is the uppercase version of the input string with a happy emoji at the end.
Validation:
The assertion is based on the expected behavior of the function, which is to convert the string to uppercase and add a happy emoji. This test is important to ensure that basic functionality is working as expected.

Scenario 2: Test with an uppercase string

Details:
Description: This test is meant to check if the function correctly handles an uppercase string and adds the happy emoji at the end.
Execution:
Arrange: Provide an uppercase string as input.
Act: Invoke the happyUpper function with the arranged input.
Assert: Assert that the returned string is the same as the input string with a happy emoji at the end.
Validation:
The assertion is based on the expected behavior of the function, which is to leave the already uppercase string as it is and add a happy emoji. This test is important to ensure the function handles uppercase strings correctly.

Scenario 3: Test with a string containing numbers

Details:
Description: This test is meant to check if the function correctly handles a string containing numbers and adds the happy emoji at the end.
Execution:
Arrange: Provide a string containing numbers as input.
Act: Invoke the happyUpper function with the arranged input.
Assert: Assert that the returned string is the same as the input string with a happy emoji at the end.
Validation:
The assertion is based on the function's expected behavior, which is to leave the string containing numbers as it is and add a happy emoji. This test is important to ensure the function handles strings containing numbers correctly.

Scenario 4: Test with an empty string

Details:
Description: This test is meant to check if the function correctly handles an empty string and returns only the happy emoji.
Execution:
Arrange: Provide an empty string as input.
Act: Invoke the happyUpper function with the arranged input.
Assert: Assert that the returned string is just the happy emoji.
Validation:
The assertion is based on the expected behavior of the function, which is to return only a happy emoji when the input string is empty. This test is important to ensure the function handles empty strings correctly.

Scenario 5: Test with a string containing special characters

Details:
Description: This test is meant to check if the function correctly handles a string containing special characters and adds the happy emoji at the end.
Execution:
Arrange: Provide a string containing special characters as input.
Act: Invoke the happyUpper function with the arranged input.
Assert: Assert that the returned string is the same as the input string with a happy emoji at the end.
Validation:
The assertion is based on the function's expected behavior, which is to leave the string containing special characters as it is and add a happy emoji. This test is important to ensure the function handles strings with special characters correctly.
