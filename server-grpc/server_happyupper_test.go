Existing Test Information:
These test cases are already implemented and not included for test generation scenario:
File: grpc_client_server/server-grpc/server_test.go
Test Cases:
    [TestHappyUpper]

Scenario 1: Testing with Alphanumeric Characters

Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check if the function operates correctly on alphanumeric inputs. The target scenario is the normal operation of the function.
Execution:
    Arrange: No need for data arrangement as this test uses hardcoded input.
    Act: Invoke the happyUpper function with the input as an alphanumeric string.
    Assert: Check if the output of the function is the uppercased version of the input appended with the emoji.
Validation:
    The assertion choice is straightforward as it directly compares the returned value with the expected result. This test is important to verify the basic functionality of the function. The expected result is the uppercased version of the input string appended with the emoji.

Scenario 2: Testing with Special Characters

Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check if the function operates correctly on special characters. The target scenario is the operation of the function on non-alphanumeric inputs.
Execution:
    Arrange: No need for data arrangement as this test uses hardcoded input.
    Act: Invoke the happyUpper function with the input as a string containing special characters.
    Assert: Check if the output of the function is the same as the input appended with the emoji.
Validation:
    The assertion choice is straightforward as it directly compares the returned value with the expected result. This test is important to verify that the function does not fail or behave unexpectedly when provided with special characters. The expected result is the input string appended with the emoji.

Scenario 3: Testing with Empty String

Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check if the function operates correctly on an empty input. The target scenario is the edge case operation of the function.
Execution:
    Arrange: No need for data arrangement as this test uses hardcoded input.
    Act: Invoke the happyUpper function with an empty string.
    Assert: Check if the output of the function is just the emoji.
Validation:
    The assertion choice is straightforward as it directly compares the returned value with the expected result. This test is important to verify the function's behavior on edge cases. The expected result is just the emoji.

Scenario 4: Testing with Unicode Characters

Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check if the function operates correctly on unicode inputs. The target scenario is the operation of the function on non-english inputs.
Execution:
    Arrange: No need for data arrangement as this test uses hardcoded input.
    Act: Invoke the happyUpper function with the input as a string containing unicode characters.
    Assert: Check if the output of the function is the same as the input appended with the emoji.
Validation:
    The assertion choice is straightforward as it directly compares the returned value with the expected result. This test is important to verify that the function does not fail or behave unexpectedly when provided with unicode characters. The expected result is the input string appended with the emoji.
