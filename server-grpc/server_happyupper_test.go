Existing Test Information:
These test cases are already implemented and not included for test generation scenario:
File: grpc_client_server/server-grpc/server_test.go
Test Cases:
    [TestHappyUpper]

Scenario 1: Test with a single lowercase letter

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the happyUpper function when a single lowercase letter is passed as argument. The target scenario is to verify if the function is able to convert the letter to uppercase and append the smiley at the end.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required
  Act: Invoke the happyUpper function with a single lowercase letter as parameter.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify if the returned string is the uppercase version of the input letter followed by a smiley.
Validation:
  The choice of assertion is to match the exact expected string with the actual result. The expected result is derived based on the functionality of the function. This test is important to ensure that the function is able to handle and correctly process single letter strings.

Scenario 2: Test with a string of multiple lowercase letters

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the happyUpper function when a string of multiple lowercase letters is passed as argument. The target scenario is to verify if the function is able to convert all the letters to uppercase and append the smiley at the end.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required
  Act: Invoke the happyUpper function with a string of multiple lowercase letters as parameter.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify if the returned string is the uppercase version of the input string followed by a smiley.
Validation:
  The choice of assertion is to match the exact expected string with the actual result. The expected result is derived based on the functionality of the function. This test is important to ensure that the function is able to handle and correctly process strings of multiple characters.

Scenario 3: Test with an empty string

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the happyUpper function when an empty string is passed as argument. The target scenario is to verify if the function is able to handle the empty string and append the smiley at the end.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required
  Act: Invoke the happyUpper function with an empty string as parameter.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify if the returned string is just the smiley.
Validation:
  The choice of assertion is to match the exact expected string with the actual result. The expected result is derived based on the functionality of the function. This test is important to ensure that the function is able to handle and correctly process empty strings.

Scenario 4: Test with a string containing special characters

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the happyUpper function when a string containing special characters is passed as argument. The target scenario is to verify if the function is able to handle the special characters and append the smiley at the end.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required
  Act: Invoke the happyUpper function with a string containing special characters as parameter.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify if the returned string is the input string followed by a smiley, since special characters cannot be converted to uppercase.
Validation:
  The choice of assertion is to match the exact expected string with the actual result. The expected result is derived based on the functionality of the function. This test is important to ensure that the function is able to handle and correctly process strings containing special characters.
