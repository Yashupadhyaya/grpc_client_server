Existing Test Information:
These test cases are already implemented and not included for test generation scenario:
File: grpc_client_server/server-grpc/server_test.go
Test Cases:
    [TestHappyUpper]

Scenario 1: Test with a Regular String

Details:
Description: This test is meant to check the happyUpper function's ability to convert a regular string into uppercase and append a happy emoji at the end.
Execution:
Arrange: The input string for this scenario is a regular word like "hello".
Act: The happyUpper function is called with the input string.
Assert: The returned string is checked to be "HELLOðŸ˜Š".
Validation:
The assertion is chosen to confirm that the happyUpper function correctly converts the string to uppercase and appends a happy emoji. This is important for the application to ensure correct string transformation.

Scenario 2: Test with a String Containing Special Characters

Details:
Description: This test is meant to check the happyUpper function's ability to handle strings containing special characters and still return the expected result.
Execution:
Arrange: The input string for this scenario is a string containing special characters like "#$%hello".
Act: The happyUpper function is called with the input string.
Assert: The returned string is checked to be "#$%HELLOðŸ˜Š".
Validation:
The assertion is chosen to confirm that the happyUpper function correctly converts the string to uppercase and appends a happy emoji, even when the string contains special characters. This is crucial for the application to handle all types of string inputs.

Scenario 3: Test with an Empty String

Details:
Description: This test is meant to check the happyUpper function's ability to handle an empty string and still return the expected result.
Execution:
Arrange: The input for this scenario is an empty string.
Act: The happyUpper function is called with the empty string.
Assert: The returned string is checked to be "ðŸ˜Š".
Validation:
The assertion is chosen to confirm that the happyUpper function correctly appends a happy emoji even when the input string is empty. This is crucial for the application to handle edge cases where the input string might be empty.

Scenario 4: Test with a String Containing Numbers

Details:
Description: This test is meant to check the happyUpper function's ability to handle strings containing numbers and still return the expected result.
Execution:
Arrange: The input string for this scenario is a string containing numbers like "hello123".
Act: The happyUpper function is called with the input string.
Assert: The returned string is checked to be "HELLO123ðŸ˜Š".
Validation:
The assertion is chosen to confirm that the happyUpper function correctly converts the string to uppercase and appends a happy emoji, even when the string contains numbers. This is crucial for the application to handle strings that contain numeric characters.
