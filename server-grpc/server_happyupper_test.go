Existing Test Information:
These test cases are already implemented and not included for test generation scenario:
File: grpc_client_server/server-grpc/server_test.go
Test Cases:
    [TestHappyUpper]

Scenario 1: Test with a Regular String

Details:
Description: This test is meant to check the happyUpper function's ability to convert a regular string into uppercase and append a happy emoji at the end.
Execution:
Arrange: The input string for this scenario is a regular word like "hello".
Act: The happyUpper function is called with the input string.
Assert: The returned string is checked to be "HELLOðŸ˜Š".
Validation:
The assertion is chosen to confirm that the happyUpper function correctly converts the string to uppercase and appends a happy emoji. This is important for the application to ensure that the function works as expected with regular strings.

Scenario 2: Test with an Empty String

Details:
Description: This test is meant to check the happyUpper function's ability to handle an empty string.
Execution:
Arrange: The input string for this scenario is an empty string "".
Act: The happyUpper function is called with the input string.
Assert: The returned string is checked to be "ðŸ˜Š".
Validation:
The assertion is chosen to confirm that the happyUpper function correctly handles an empty string by returning only the happy emoji. This is important for the application to ensure that the function doesn't crash or behave unexpectedly when given an empty string.

Scenario 3: Test with a String Containing Special Characters

Details:
Description: This test is meant to check the happyUpper function's ability to handle a string containing special characters.
Execution:
Arrange: The input string for this scenario is a string containing special characters like "h@llo$".
Act: The happyUpper function is called with the input string.
Assert: The returned string is checked to be "H@LLO$ðŸ˜Š".
Validation:
The assertion is chosen to confirm that the happyUpper function correctly handles a string with special characters by converting only the alphabetic characters to uppercase and appending a happy emoji. This is important for the application to ensure that the function works as expected with strings containing special characters.

Scenario 4: Test with a String Containing Numbers

Details:
Description: This test is meant to check the happyUpper function's ability to handle a string containing numbers.
Execution:
Arrange: The input string for this scenario is a string containing numbers like "h3ll0".
Act: The happyUpper function is called with the input string.
Assert: The returned string is checked to be "H3LL0ðŸ˜Š".
Validation:
The assertion is chosen to confirm that the happyUpper function correctly handles a string with numbers by converting only the alphabetic characters to uppercase and appending a happy emoji. This is important for the application to ensure that the function works as expected with strings containing numbers.
